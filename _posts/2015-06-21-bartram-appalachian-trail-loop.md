#### Day 1 - Nantahala Lake to Piercy Creek (10.5 miles)

This stretch is mostly easy. It does have two 700-800 foot climbs, but neither is very steep. Otherwise, the terrain is relatively flat as it follows the Nantahala River. The poor maintenance of the trail counteracts the easy elevation profile, however. Quite a bit of the hike involves pushing through barely-visible trail in high brush often with briars and sometimes poison ivy. Also, you’ll find yourself climing over fallen branches at times and, at other times, crawling on hands and knees under fallen trees. We happened to get lucky with weather. The camp site at the junction of the Bartram and Piercy Creek trails is nice and has easy access to water.

#### Day 2 - Piercy Creek to FR-259 (10.5 miles)

The first 6 miles to the Nantahala boat launch is again relatively easy. The trail climbes 1000 feet to the top of Rattlesnake Bald and then decends 2000 feet to the Nantahala River near the raft put-in. The relatively shallow grade makes this stretch easy in spite of the elevation change. After that, there is about a 1 mile walk on a sidewalk that follows the river. Then a bridge crosses to the Winding Stairs trailhead below Cheoah Bald. The climb to the top of Cheoah covers 3000 feet in just 5 miles. The first 1.5 miles which I imagine would be called “Winding Stairs” is brutally steep and difficult. For the most part, we walked blaze-to-blaze stopping to catch our breath at each one. The combination of steepness and lack of maintenance make this a very slow-moving section. The camp site about 1/4 mile south of the FR-259 intersection is a great site with easy access to water.

### Day 3 - FR-259 to Rufus Morgan Shelter (9.0 miles)

The final 1.5 miles to the summit of Cheoah Bald is steep, but reasonably well maintianed. Cheoah Bald is the northern terminus of the Bartram Trail. There is a very nice camping area atop the bald but there is no water. The next water source is located at the Sassafras shelter about a mile south of the bald. We continued on the Appalichain Trial south to the Nantahala Outdoor Center. While the 3000-foot decent is sometimes steep, the trail is very well maintained and hiking is reasonably easy. We stopped at the NOC for a quick swim/bath in the Nantahala River, dinner, and beers. After about 3 hours there, we continued another 0.8 miles south on the AT to the Rufus Morgan Shelter.

#### Day 4 - Rufus Morgan Shelter to Wesser Shelter (5.0 miles)

After three difficult days, we decided to have a low-mileage day, which is good because this section involves some very difficult climb. Most of the approximately 2000 feet of elevation gain happens in the first 3 miles. The camping area above the Wesser Bald Shelter has plenty of room and even bear cables to make things easy. While water is not at the shelter, there is a very reliable concrete box spring about 1/4 mile further south from the shelter, uphill of course. There are no markings at the shelter area to indicate where the water source is. While it wouldn’t be missed on a traditional northbound hike, southbounders could have difficulty finding the water source. Pushing on to the Cold Spring shelter a few more miles south was a possibility here, but we wanted to be lazy for a day.

#### Day 5 - Wesser Shelter to Nantahala Lake (19.5 miles)

We started the day with a quick climb to the Wesser Bald firetower. The 360-degree view from the tower is incredible, perhaps the best views on the entire trip. From there, our intent was to hike about 9 more miles to the campsite where the AT and Bartram trials converge just south of the Wayah Shelter. However, we got there fairly early and decided to push on another 2.8 miles through Wayah Bald and camp at Wine Spring where the Bartram and AT diverge again. We took a fairly long break at Wayah Bald. The views from observation tower are great and well worth the extra time. When we got to Wine Spring, the camping area was completely overun by Boy Scouts – dozens of tents and lots of noise. Rather than camp near the scouts, we decided to just hike on in hope of finding another site. About 2 miles in, we realized that there weren’t going to be more sites, and we didn’t have enough water to camp anyway nor did we want to backtrack to Wine Spring which is the last water access until Nantahala Lake. We decided to hike the rest of the way out, making our hike nearly 20 miles for the day. We finished our hike one day early and closed out the day with great burgers, chili dogs, and Cokes at the Lakes End Grill.

#### Special thanks

We’d really like to thank the awesome folks at the [Lakes End Grill](http://visitlakesend.com/). We got off the trail and made it back to the restaurant about 25 minutes after they closed, but they were willing to stay open late for us. The food is fantastic, and our server Steven along with the rest of the staff, couldn’t be friendlier. Don’t miss a chance to eat here if in the area.
