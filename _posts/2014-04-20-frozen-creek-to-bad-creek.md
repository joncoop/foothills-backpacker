#### Day 1 –Frozen Creek Access to Toxaway Creek (5 miles)

From the Frozen Creek parking area, it is an easy, mostly downhill hike along the five-mile Canebrake Trail to get to the camp sites on the edge of Lake Jocassee. There are numerous great sites, all with picnic tables and fire rings along Toxaway Creek and on the shore of Jocassee. We got there early so we had plenty of time for unsuccessful fishing and exploring.

#### Day 2 -Toxaway Creek Access to Auger Hole (7 miles)

Bill, Chris, and Paula couldn’t stay out the entire four days, so they stayed behind to hike out the next day while the rest of us hiked on. The hike today covered the stretch of the Foothills Trail contained in Gorges State Park. After leaving the campground and crossing the Toxayway River on the suspension bridge, the trail winds around Lake Jocassee briefly before a very steep ascent. After that, it is a relatively easy ridgeline hike for a few miles. We continued on the trail until just past the junction of the Foothills Trail with the Auger Hole Trial. After a quick descent, maybe a half mile or so, there are a few nice sites with easy access to water.
