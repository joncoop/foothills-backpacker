Try this classic Indian dish with shredded chicken in a creamy tomato-yogurt sauce served over white rice. I’ve created a recipe especially for the trail. It’s easy to make, inexpensive, and simple to prepare at camp. Tasty too! I hope you find this to be a nice change from the usual Lipton sides and instant potatoes.

### Ingredients:

- 1 large onion
- 3 serrano peppers
- 28 oz. pureed tomatoes
- 14 oz. tomato sauce
- 3 cloves garlic, crushed to paste
- 2 tablespoons ginger, crushed to paste
- 2 5.5 oz containers fat-free, plain Greek yogurt
- Juice of 1/2 lime
- 5 teaspoons coriander
- 4 teaspoons dried cilantro
- 4 teaspoons cumin
- 2 teaspoons cardamom
- 2 teaspoons paprika
- 1 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt & pepper to taste
- 4 12.5 oz cans premium white chicken breast*
- 4 cups instant white rice


### Cook:

Dice the onion and serrano peppers and spread on non-stick foil on a baking tray and roast in the oven at 450 degrees for 15 minutes. While the vegetables are roasting, add tomatoes, garlic, ginger, yogurt, lime juice, and spices to a dutch oven and simmer over medium-low heat. Add the veggies when they finish roasting. Simmer for an additional 15 minutes. Add salt & pepper to taste. When your ready to dehydrate, add all of the chicken to the pot and stir to break up until the chicken is almost shredded. Larger chunks may not rehydrate well. There is no need to simmer after the chicken has been added.

### Dehydrate:

Spread evenly onto 4 fruit roll trays and dehydrate for about 10 hours at 155 degrees. Flipping once about halfway through will help. Finished product will be dry and crumbly.

### Pack:

Divide evenly into 6 vacuum bags. Add 2/3 of a cup of instant white rice to each bag. Also include packet of olive oil. Vacuum and seal. For long-term storage, keep in your freezer.

### Prepare:

Empty contents into 1-quart freezer bag and add 14-16 oz. of boiling water. Stir and let sit in pot cozy for 20 minutes. Add olive oil.

If you really wanted to make it look pretty, then I suppose you could pack the chicken/sauce mixture separately and pour the sauce over the rice after dehydrating each. But this is trail food. Keep it simple. How fancy does it really need to look if you’re eating it with a spork?

### Calories:

Chicken & sauce, 250. Rice, 210. Olive oil, 80. Total: 540


### Cost:
About $4.50 per serving

(Generally, I don’t include spices in the cost, and I haven’t here. Be warned however that the cardamom is fairly expensive, expect to pay around $10 for a jar. It’s a one-time purchase though.)

### Notes:

- You do not want to use fresh chicken breasts in this recipe. Canned chicken has been pressure cooked and will rehydrate much better.
