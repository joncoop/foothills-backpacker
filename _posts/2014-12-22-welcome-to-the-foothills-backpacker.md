I’ve had the desire to make a backpacking site for a few years now, but have never really had the time to commit to it. Well, now I do… sort of. I think the primary focus of the site will be on some of the lesser known trails around the Southeast. I’m sure that I’ll post some about my adventures on the Appalachain Trail too, but there are plenty of great sites focusing on the AT already. Cooking on the trail is another hobby of mine, so I hope to get plenty of recipes posted here as well. Should be fun. Thanks for checking this site out. Hope you enjoy!
