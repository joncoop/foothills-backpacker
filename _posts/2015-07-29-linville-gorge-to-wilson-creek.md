#### Day 1 – Conley Cove to Linville River (4 miles)

Around mid-morning, we dropped my truck off at the Wilson Creek Visitor Center. The drive up Brown Mountain Beach Rd. is spectacular in itself with awesome views into the Wilson Creek Gorge. Then Mike drove to the Conley Cove trailhead on the west side of Linville Gorge. Most of the drive through the Harper Creek Wilderness area is on gravel forest roads, some with significant incline. If the weather isn’t nice, you may want to consider an alternate route that sticks more to paved highways. The Kistler Memorial Highway (it’s not a highway) to the Conley Cove trailhead is a particularly rough and steep gravel road. If you don’t have a truck, you may want to consider parking at one of three trailheads north of Conley Cove that also provide access to the Linville Gorge Trail.

From the Conley Cove trailhead, it’s about 1.4 miles to the junction with the Linville Gorge Trail. The trail is steep but only moderately strenuous, at least on the way down. We chose this trail because it is one of the easiest accesses to the gorge. We walked along the Linville River for about 2.5 miles before setting up camp. A short day gave us some time to enjoy the river and fish a bit in the evening. There are plenty of great camping spots along the river.

#### Day 2 – Linville River to MST/Linville River Crossing (5 miles)

This was another slow walking day. As you go south on the Linville Gorge trail, it obviously becomes less traveled. There are no blazes, and more than once we found ourselves off the trail having to do a little bit of bushwhacking until we refound it. The printed maps we downloaded at linvillegorge.net were extremely helpful for this section as they showed much more detail than the official forest service map of the area.

Near the end of the Linville Gorge trail, there is an unofficial trail referred to as the Leadmine Trial which is a 1-mile connector from the Linville Gorge to the Mountains to Sea Trial. You’ll need to use the maps from linvillegorge.net to locate this trail as it is not on forest service maps. The Leadmine Trail is well-established and easy to follow, however it is extremely strenuous and steep enough that it could be near impossible to take in bad weather. We followed the MST east back down to the Linville River. After fording the river, we set up camp for one more night on the river.

Our original plans were to camp atop Shortoff this night, but the threat of lightning caused us to spend a little extra time by the river before heading up the Leadmine Trail.

#### Day 3 – MST/Linville River Crossing to Table Rock Parking (8 miles)

The climb from the river up to Shortoff is strenuous but beautiful. The landscape changes almost immediately after leaving the river, quickly providing views of the gorge from the rocky and fire-ravaged terrain. From Shortoff, the trail to Table Rock is mostly along the top of rock faces or burned mountain tops. The river is as far as 1400 feet below the ridge in some places, and you will definitely notice. A peek over the edge in some places will sometimes show drops of several hundred feet straight down into the gorge. In other places difficult rock scrambling is required, especially in the section between the Chimneys and Table Rock. Signs at the Table Rock parking area warn about bringing small children in the area. Take these warnings very seriously. The MST often goes very near the edge of cliffs.

The only water source on this stretch is a spring know as the ‘water tree’. A spur trail to the spring is located maybe a half mile or so north of the summit of Shortoff. Again, the printed maps will help you find this source.

Mike got off the trail at Table Rock and hitched a ride back to his truck on the other side of the gorge. I stayed the night at the camping area just past the picnic area. There is no water at the campsite, so make sure you stock up plenty at the water tree or have water waiting for you at a car in the parking area.

#### Day 4 –Table Rock Parking to Harper Creek (18 miles)

I got an early jump on the day so that I could get into the Harper Creek Wilderness. Do take time to summit Table Rock. From the summit, you have views showing the entire length of the gorge. From Table Rock, the MST continues north about 1 more mile before veering east out of the Linville Gorge Wilderness where it joins Forest Road 496. There is a small runoff that looks like it should be a fairly reliable water source at the junction. This is the first water source you will see after the water tree. If you don’t have water to stay at Table Rock, the section between this junction and Steels Creek has a couple of campsites. From the first junction with the road, it is about 4 more miles of fairly easy trail to get to Steels Creek.

The MST turns north and follows Steels Creek for a little under 4 miles. The map make it look like this will be an easy, creekside stroll. Don’t be fooled like I was. There are few very difficult sections on this hike. I really wish I had one extra day to camp on Steels Creek. There are several great sites, swimming holes, and waterfalls to check out. The Steels Creek/MST section ends at Forest Road 228 where you’ll have to walk another mile on the road until you cross Highway 181.

After crossing 181, the MST is also called the Greentown Trail for 3.4 miles. This stretch has good camping opportunities and plenty of water. I continued another 5 miles until the MST intersects the Harper Creek trail in the Harper Creek Wilderness and set up camp next to Harper Creek.

#### Day 5 – Harper Creek to Wilson Creek Visitor Center (4 miles)

I took a quick detour, maybe a 1/4 mile, north up the MST trail to check out Harper Creek falls. From the MST, it’s a pretty difficult scramble down to the falls, but it is well worth the effort. It is a beautiful waterfall with a great swimming hole at the base. It’s a very popular destination for day hikers, so expect crowds on the weekends or try to hit it early in the morning. I doubled-back on the MST back to the junction with the Harper Creek trail and followed the trail for maybe 1.5 miles to Brown Mountain Beach Rd. The hike concluded with a 2-mile road walk south along Wilson Creek to the Visitor Center.
