A delicious, calorie-filled take on a French classic. Easy to cook at home, and even easier to prepare on the trail.

### Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 ½ pounds lean ground beef
- ¾ cups bread crumbs
- 1 medium yellow onion (1 cup diced)
- 2 carrots (about 1 cup diced)
- 2 cloves minced garlic
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 4 cups lamb stock
- 1/2 cup frozen corn
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 2 teaspoons rosemary
- 1 teaspoon thyme
- 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
- 3 cups instant cheddar mashed potatoes
- 9 tablespoons powdered milk
- salt & pepper

### Cook:

Add olive oil, onions, carrots and a pinch of salt to pot over medium-high heat. Saute until the vegetables take on a little color, about 7 minutes. Add garlic and tomato paste and sweat for 1 more minute. Add lamb stock to deglaze bottom of pot.  Add rosemary, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Reduce heat to low.

In a large mixing bowl, thoroughly incorporate bread crumbs into ground beef. Brown the ground beef over medium heat (maybe a little less than medium as bread crumbs burn easily). Pour meat in colander and rinse under hot water to remove any fat. Then add meat to pot.

Simmer over low heat for 1 hour. Then add corn and peas. Turn off heat and let rest for 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.

###Dehydrate:

Spread evenly onto 4 fruit roll trays and dehydrate for 10-12 hours at 155 degrees. Finished product will be dry and crumbly.

### Pack:

Divide filling evenly into 6 zip top vacuum bags. Also include packet of olive oil. Vacuum and seal. Store filling in freezer until trip.

In 6 separate vacuum bags, combine ½ cup instant potatoes with 3 tablespoons of powdered milk and a pinch of salt and pepper. Vacuum and seal.

### Prepare:

Add about 12 oz. of boiling water to the meat filling. Stir and let sit in pot cozy for at least 15 minutes. Optionally add olive oil. Stir about 6 oz. of boiling water into potato mix. When filling is ready, top with potatoes.

### Cost:
About $4.00 per serving

### Notes:

I like to build my shepherd’s pie upside down. That is, when the meat filling is ready, I make the potatoes in a bowl and then top with the filling. Sure, traditionally shepherd’s pie is topped with potatoes, but it tastes the same with potatoes on the bottom and is a little less messy to prepare.
