#### Day 1 – Camp Daniel Boone to Flat Laurel Creek (12 miles)

I’d like to start by thanking Harry from Asheville Airport Shuttle. We met him at the Davidson River Campground at 8:30 in the morning so that we could drop my truck off and then got shuttled to northern terminus at Camp Daniel Boone. The ride from Davidson to Daniel Boone is about an hour, so we were on the trail around 9:30.

The hike starts with a quick ascent, I think around 2800 feet in under three miles, to get to Deep Gap. Be sure to get water at one of the small creek crossings on the way up as there will be no more water until you reach Shining Rock Gap several miles away. This is a very dry trail overall, so plan accordingly. At Deep Gap, the trail turns to south. There is also a spur that goes north to the summit of Cold Mountain. When hiking on the portion of the trail in the Shining Rock Wilderness, be aware that there are no blazes marking the trail. Having some map and compass reading skills is important. Also, the northern sections of the trail aren’t heavily traveled, so the footpath is not always obvious to follow. Take time at junctions to be sure you head off in the right directions.

Once you reach Deep Gap, the trail follows the ridgeline all the way to Black Balsam before descending to the Blue Ridge Parkway. This could be the most stunningly beautiful hike in the Carolinas. Pay special attention at Shining Rock Gap. There are several trails that meet at this junction and it is not obvious which one is the continuation of the Art Loeb. (Check out my short video Navigating Shining Rock Gap.) At Black Balsam, the trail continues southbound and decends to the Parkway. However, we decided to get off the trail and take the Art Loeb Spur down to the parking area and then decend a bit further to camp along Flat Laurel Creek. It was cold and windy, so we made the decision to spend the night off the ridgeline in our hammocks. Also, we wanted to camp near a reliable water source.

Give yourself extra time to complete this section. Normally, I would estimate it to take me about 5 hours to hike 12 miles when factoring in water stops, snacks, etc. However on this section, it isn’t possible to go that fast. It isn’t the elevation. The trail is just so rocky and sometimes overgrown that it really slows down the hiking. It took us considerably longer than expected to complete this stretch, maybe close to 8 hours total. You should also allot plenty of extra time just to enjoy the views.

#### Day 2 – Flat Laurel Creek to  Butter Gap (10 miles)

Rather than hike back up to the summit of Black Balsam and rejoin the Art Loeb, we took the Sam’s Knob trail to the Mountans to Sea and then rejoined the Art Loeb near the parkway. From here, the trail is more wooded. It is also well maintained and actually blazed. We got water from a creek near the Pilot Mountain shelter before ascending. The hike to the top of Pilot Mountain was difficult, but we were rewarded with great 360-degree views. We camped a few miles further down the trail at the Butter Gap shelter. There is a nice pipe spring right next to the shelter and even bear cables to make it easy.

#### Day 3 – Butter Gap to Davidson River Campground (9 miles)

This was the easiest day by far. The rock face (Cedar Rock?) you pass shortly after leaving the shelter is really interesting. There are a couple of water sources on this stretch, so you don’t have to carry quite so much. We filled up at the Shut In Branch creek where the trail crosses Horse Cove Road. When the trail descends into the Davidson River area, there is still another mile or so of sidewalk trail to get back to the trailhead. We closed out the hike with a much needed soaking of our ankles and knees in the icy Davidson River.
