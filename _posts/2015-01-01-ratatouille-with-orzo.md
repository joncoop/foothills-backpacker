A delicious, calorie-filled take on a French classic. Easy to cook at home, and even easier to prepare on the trail.

### Ingredients:

- 2 medium eggplants
- 2 medium yellow squash
- 2 medium zuchinni
- 2 red bell peppers
- 2 yellow bell peppers
- 1 large sweet onion
- 3 cloves garlic, mashed to paste
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- salt & pepper
- dried parsley
- roasted red pepper marinara
- 16 oz. box orzo

### Cook:

Cook and dehydrate marinara sauce from this recipe.

Cook and dehydrate a 16 oz. box of orzo pasta.

Dice all the veggies into bite-size pieces, about 1 cm. by 1 cm. Mash the garlic into a paste. In a large mixing bowl, mix all veggies, garlic paste, balsamic vinegar, and salt & pepper. Spread the veggies onto two parchment-lined baking trays and roast in the oven at 425 degrees for 40 minutes. About half way through, turn the veggies on the trays and rotate trays to opposite racks.

### Dehydrate:

Spread veggies evenly onto 4 fruit roll trays and dehydrate for about 10 hours at 135 degrees. Flipping once about halfway through will help. Finished product will be a bit spongy, somewhat like store-bought dried fruit.

### Pack:

By weight, divide veggies, sauce, and pasta evenly into six freezer bags, and add a pinch of dried parsley to each. For long-term storage, divide into vacuum bags and seal. The meal should keep several months or over a year if kept in the freezer. Pack with an olive oil packet for extra calories.

### Prepare:

Empty contents into 1-quart freezer bag and add 12-14 oz. of boiling water. Stir and let sit in pot cozy for 15 minutes. Add olive oil.
