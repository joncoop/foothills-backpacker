#### Day 1 – Table Rock to Cantrel Homesite (8 miles)

We were doing a north-to-south hike, and our friend Larry was joining us for the first night out. We dropped his car off at the Laurel Valley access and stashed a few days of food in the car – no need to carry the full suppy since we were coming by the car anyway. Mike’s parents then took us to the trailhead at Table Rock State Park for an 11 AM start.

The northernmost section of the FHT passes over the three highest mountains in South Carolina: Pinnacle, Hickory Nut, and Sassafras. The first section of the trail features a very steep 2000-foot climb over just 3 miles to reach the top of Pinnacle Mountain. Along the way, we stopped for lunch on Bald Knob to enjoy the views and took another short break to check out the petroglypys just past Pinnacle Mountian. The good thing about getting the climb out of the way early is that the rest of the day is comparatively easy. The Cantrel Home Site was our destination for the night, and that was about 5 more miles past Pinnacle. It was a clear night with no chance of rain, so Mike and I didn’t bother setting up tents. Instead, we just slept under the stars. Larry did sleep in the tent. The next morning, he was sure he heard “something big” roaming around at night. If there was something out there, I never knew. I slept soundly through the night protected by nothing but my sleeping bag.

#### Day 2 – Cantrel to Laurel Falls (14 miles)

The next morning, we had breakfast with oatmeal and blueberries and blackberries picked along the way. The push to the top of Sassafras was quick an easy. The summit is mostly wooded other than the parking area so it doesn’t offer much in the way of views. I think there are plans to build some sort of overlook in the future, however. The trek from Sassafras to the Laurel Valley access is easy, although sometimes a bit steep on the downhill sections. Larry got off the trail here.

Mike and I continued on to Laurel Falls at Lake Jocasssee. There is only one climb of significance, and it is early in this stretch. After that, it is a really interesting trail with many interesting bridges as the trail criss-crosses Laurel Creek for much of the eight-mile stretch to the lake. There is a well-established campground atop the falls, but we went past the campground and down a short spur trail to A4 access point – rocky outcrop into lake. There we swam and set up camp on the outcrop. It was another clear night, so we went tentless again. There was even room enough for a small fire.

#### Day 3 – Laurel Falls to Toxaway (5 miles)

We decided to make this day a short one and just go six miles to campground in Gorges State Park, an area also popular with boaters. It’s a good thing we kept it short because the hike along the lake is brutal. This is the stretch that features steep stairs on Heartbreak Ridge. (In some places, it’s hardly fair to call these ‘stairs’ as the spacing and steepness is more ladder-like.) We got into the campsite early enough in the afternoon to spend some time fishing and bouncing on the 220-foot Toxaway River suspension bridge. Then Mike, always the smooth talker, managed to get us on a pontoon boat where we spent a good bit of the afternoon bumming beers and relaxing. There are several nice campsites along the lake shore and on Toxaway Creek, each with a picnic table which is especially nice after spending the first couple days hunched over stoves on the ground at mealtime. We did set up tents, and that was good because it poured for several hours overnight.

#### Day 4 – Toxaway to Bear Camp Creek (9 miles)

The next stretch of trail is where we could really sense the remoteness of the FHT. It is part of a 30-mile section between parking areas at Laurel Valley (A4) and Bad Creek (A7a). We stopped at the Horsepasture river to fish some more and managed to pull in a stringer full of brim and small catfish. Dinner! After our fishing break, we continued on to the campsites along Bear Camp Creek. Mike went off to the creek to clean up. The next thing I knew, Mike was running out of the creek screaming, “Jon, get a pot!” naked holding only a dirty shirt in one hand for privacy and a crawdad in the other hand.Not too long after we got set up, it poured again, but it did clear up for a bit after dinner, giving us time to cook the fish and one crawdad along with our regular meals.

#### Day 5 – Bear Camp Creek to Whitewater… and bad decisions (12 miles)

The first 4 days had gone almost exacly as planned. It was pretty clear to us that we were well on our way to becoming expert woodsmen. So we thought we’d make up for it by cramming in as many stupid decisions as possible today. The plan was to walk from Bear Camp Creek to Round Mountain Gap just past Whitewater Falls, which was probably an easy 11 miles. However, we made it difficult with a side adventure. The FHT crosses each of the four major rivers that feed Lake Jocassee, one of which is the Thompson River. About a mile north of the trail is Big Falls. It’s fairly easy to pick out on the topographic map just by checking out the contour lines. Our plan was to hike the ridgline to the west of the river and then plunge back into the gorge once we were even with the falls. So we left the trail, hid our packs, grabbed a map and compass, and managed to find a reminants of promising but unmaintained spur trail that went in approximately the right direction paralleling the river along a ridgeline. The trail, while unmaintained, was easy enough to follow and we walked along listening for the falls. Once we thought we heard the falls, we turned east off the spur and slid the couple hundred feet down to the river, mostly on our rear ends, holding rhododendron branches to slow the descent. After two tries at this, we found the falls. Big Falls is one of the more amazing falls you can find in the area. It is about 120 feet high, and while there are some bigger, but few that you can get this intimate with. We came out at the base of the falls and did some boulder hopping to cross the river. From the east side, we were able to climb about half way up the falls. So then it was time to head back. We hopped back across the river and then pulled ourselves up the mountain by rhododendron branches to hook back up with the spur to the FHT.

We probably should have payed more attention to compass on our way back up. We definitely never found that spur and it sure seemed like we went up quite a bit further than we went down. According to our limited ability to read a topographic map, we guessed that we had turned much more to the north than to the west in our ascent. Needless to say, we had no idea where we were. So, we took a guess and turned toward where we thought the spur trail might be. We never did find the spur, but in the bushwacking through thorny bushes as we took turns confidently declaring and then agreeably confirming that “this looks familiar” and “the trail should be right over there.” Somewhere along the way, I managed to lose the map. It must have gotten snagged on some brush and pulled out of my pocket. Fortunately, we stumbled across some horsetrails, which surely we could follow back to the FHT. Of course, without a map, we didn’t know which way to go. Time for more confident guessing. After the third time we passed the same can of Bud Light Ice, it was pretty clear we were walking in circles. Also, the sun was setting. And we had no water. While neither of us spoke it, both Mike and I were mentally planning how to spend the night in the woods with no shelter. We both have watched quite a bit of Survivorman, so maybe we wouldn’t die. Did I mention that we didn’t bring water on this short little diversion to the falls? I mean, it was only going to take an hour or so, why carry the water.

At least we still had a compass, and the only thing we knew for sure at this point was that the Foothills Trail was south of us. So we began to bushwhack south, only deviating from that direction when we reached impassible terrain. After a couple hours, we did meet up with the FHT again, at a junction about three miles south of where we hid our packs. So at this point, it was getting dark and we had to backtrack to the Thompson River to find our packs. We finally found our hidden packs, fortunately intact as we weren’t even smart enough to pull the food out and hang it, around 8:30 P.M.

It quickly got dark and we hiked south on the trail, arriving at a quite illegal (but very nice) site around 1:00 AM. Before bed, I did catch a handful of nice sized crawdads. We kept those in a pot overnight and had them with breakfast the next day. While we only covered around 12 trail miles, the actual distance we walked today was probably closer to 20.

Note: I have since found a better way to the falls [link]

#### Day 6 – Whitewater River to Burrells Ford (12 miles)

The late night meant a late start today. At least we were lucky enough to get packed up before the rain cam. But then had to hike in a downpour until it finally cleared up when we reached the overlook and parking area at Upper Whitewater Falls. After checking out the falls, we stopped at a picnic table under an unoccupied pavilion for lunch and were promptly shooed away by an unsympathetic park ranger. Apparently, reservations are required at pavilions and our desire to have a quick snack at a table and change socks after being poured on most of the morning was too much to ask.

Our friends and kids were meeting us at Burrells Ford the next day and we were a little of schedule because of our misadventures the previous day. We continued are hike well after dark and pushed all the way to Burrells Ford, arriving after midnight.

#### Day 7 – Friends, kids, cold beer! (0 miles)

I woke up early and walked the ½ mile down trail to the parking area and left markers along the trail so our friends could find us. They arrived mid-morning, bringing in a cooler of beer, chicken, potatoes, and more. This was a really great day and night of hanging out by the river and picking blueberries with the kids.

#### Day 8 – Burrells Ford to beach sites after Big Bend (6 miles)

We probably could have hiked out today but chose not to so that we could spend one more night on the river. After saying goodbye to our friends, we hiked along the Chattooga River to a beach site a couple miles south of the Big Bend access trail. We spent the afternoon fishing, pulled in a couple nice trout for dinner and puffed on a couple victory cigars before turning in for the night.

#### Day 9 – Beach to Oconee State Park (10 miles)

The final day was rather and really wasn’t all that interesting relative to the rest of the trail. After about three miles along the bank of the Chattooga, we turned up the mountain toward Pig Pen Falls. After that, it was a short push over Dodge Mountain, a road crossing, and then an easy stroll to the park. This stretch is more of a wooded walk than strenuous trail hiking. We asked some day hikers to snap a picture of us at the trailhead before we walked the road back to the car ending our adventure.
