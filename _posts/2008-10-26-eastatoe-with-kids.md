The hike in is easy. For the first 1.5 miles, the trail is mostly flat with just enough hills to know your really hiking, but not so much that kids will complain. The trail finishes with a series of steep switchbacks and stairs for the last half mile or so as it decends a few hundred feet into the gorge. There are plenty of primative campsites along Eastatoe Creek. This is a great starter hike for kids or first-time adult backpackers as you get a taste of primative camping without having to carry gear 10 miles or deal with difficult terrain.

**Note:** When driving to the trailhead, you can take the gravel road past the Laurel Valley parking area for the Foothills Trail (A4) and park near the gate instead.

**Update:** As of June 17, 2013, SCDNR has imposed a camping ban in the gorge due to danger from dead and dying hemlock trees falling.
