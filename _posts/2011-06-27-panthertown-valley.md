I didn’t have much of a plan for this trip. My intentions were more just to wander around, camping wherever I was when I felt like stopping. I parked at the Cold Mountain Gap trailhead and hopped on the Panthertown Creek Trial.  I shot down a spur to check out Schoolhouse Falls. This seemed like a pretty popular spot. There were numerous day hikers here along with their dogs playing in the pool at the base of the falls. Then I continued on the Panthertown Vallley Trail before making a detor to check out Granny Burrell Falls.  From there, I followed the Great Wall Trail, checking out the only shelter in the area and walking along the base of the wall. After that, I proceded up to the Big Green Trail with a brief detour to the top of the Great Wall to check out the views. Then I headed back east on Mac’s Gap and Greenland Creek trails until I found a small campsite near the base of Greenland Creek Falls. I spent the remainder of the afternoon in the hammock, reading and sipping on bourbon.

I originally intended to spend two nights out, but after walking around, I realized what a small area it is. It’s also very crowded with both day hikers and mountain bikers on many of the trails. I decided to hike out a day early instead. While I did enjoy my night in Panthertown, I really don’t think this is a great area for backpacking/camping, especially considering all of the other options nearby. It would make a nice day hike though. If I go back, that’s more likely what I’ll do.
