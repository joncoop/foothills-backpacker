This will warm the soul on a cold night.

### Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 1/2 pounds lean ground beef
- 1 cup bread crumbs
- 1 large yellow onion (about 1 ½ cups diced)
- 3 chopped serrano peppers
- 4 chopped chipotle pepper in adobo sauce
- 3 cloves minced garlic
- 28 oz. can crushed tomatoes
- 14 oz. can beef broth
- 12 oz. beer
- 3 15.5 oz. cans kidney beans
- ¼ cup masa flour or a handful of tortilla chips
- 4 tablespoons chili powder
- 2  tablespoons cumin
- 1 tablespoon smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- salt & pepper

### Cook:

In a large dutch oven, add olive oil, onions, peppers, and a pinch of salt to pot over medium heat. Sweat for about 5 minutes until vegetables are soft. Add garlic and sweat for 1 more minute. Add chipotle peppers, tomatoes, broth, beer, tortillas, spices, and a dash of liquid smoke. Reduce heat to low.

In a large mixing bowl, thoroughly incorporate bread crumbs into ground beef. Brown the ground beef in batches over medium heat (maybe a little less than medium as bread crumbs burn easily). After each batch is browned, pour meat in colander and rinse under hot water to remove any fat. Then add meat to pot.

Simmer over low heat for 2 hours. Add salt & pepper to taste.

### Dehydrate:

Spread evenly onto 4 fruit roll trays and dehydrate for about 10 hours at 155 degrees. Flipping once about halfway through will help. Finished product will be dry and crumbly.

### Pack:

Divide evenly into 6 zip top vacuum bags. Also include packets of Tabasco, parmesan cheese, and olive oil. Vacuum and seal. Store in freezer until trip.

Tip: Dehydrated ground beef is sharp and tends to make tiny holes in vacuum bags when sealed. Use an unsealed sandwich bag as a liner between the chili and the vacuum bag.

### Prepare:

Add about 10-12 oz. of boiling water to vacuum bag. Stir and let sit in pot cozy for at least 15 minutes. Optionally add cheese, Tabasco, and olive oil.
