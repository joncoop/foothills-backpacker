### Summary

I’ve done the Foothills Trail/Fork Mountain loop several times. On this trip, I tacked on a 4.7 mile spur to the Whitewater Falls parking area mostly because a friend needed to hike that section to complete the Foothills Trail. This was a four-day trip, but I only hiked for two. The middle days were spent at camp fishing, reading, drinking beer, and playing with fire.

### Trip details:

#### Day 1 – Whitewater Falls Parking to East Fork Creek (13.5 miles)

I parked at the Whitewater Falls parking area (not at the overlook but at the A8 FHT access) around 11:00 AM. For the first day of the trip, I hiked solo. Heading south on the FHT, the trip starts with a quick climb up Round Mountain. I doubt its more than a couple hundred feet and it’s not very strenuous. The first 4.7 mile stretch to Sloan Bridge isn’t particularly interesting other than the views of the Bad Creek reservoir. (In the summer, the reservoir is hardly visible through the trees.)

After arriving at the Sloan Bridge access (A9), I continued south on the FHT along the Medlin Mountain Ridge to Burrell’s Ford. Although this isn’t a particularly scenic section of the trail it can be a really pleasant hike in good weather. The first section of this stretch is 3.3 miles to Fish Hatchery Road. It mostly follows along the East Fork of the Chattooga River and has a few nice rapids and falls to check out.

The next stretch covers 3.9 miles to Burrell’s Ford. This is a very easy section as it gradually descends about 600 feet along the way. (This is might be the longest dry stretch of the FHT, so it’s a good idea to make sure you have a little water prior to reaching Fish Hatchery Road.

After reaching Burrell’s Ford Road, I hiked about 1/4 mile to the Chattooga River trailhead. Mike gave me a spare car key to hike in with, so I stopped at his truck to grab a bag of beers and fishing supplies that I left with him earlier. From there, I hiked north on Chattooga River trail 1.5 miles to just south of East Fork junction with Chattooga River. This is a very wide-open camping area with plenty of sites, and it is commonly referred to as the Boyscout Camp. (It’s not an official camp, it’s just a good area for large groups so sometimes scouts camp there.)

I reached camp to meet Mike around 4:30 and as always, he was well-supplied with food. He had a cooler with a pork tenderloin that we cooked over the fire that night, a cooler of beer, and two monster rainbow trout that he caught earlier that day.

#### Days 2 and 3 – Camp (0 miles)

Each day, we did make the 3-mile round trip to the car and back for resupplies of beer and ice. Otherwise, we just hung around camp. Bill came in on day 3. He also started at Whitewater and hiked in the same route I took.

#### Day 4 – East Fork Creek to Whitewater Falls Parking (13.5 miles)

Mike was able to stay an extra night, but Bill and I needed to leave on the 4th day. Rather than hike out the way we came in, we continued north along the river. 1.8 miles to Ellicott Rock. The rock itself can be a bit tricky to find. You’re looking for a a steep ‘trail’ where you can scramble about 15 feet down to the edge of the river. (I should have taken a picture of the trail from the top.) The inscriptions are carved into two rocks on the east bank of the river about at eye level if you’re standing on the rocks at water level. It’s really quite unimpresive, but I suppose it’s one of those things you need to find just to say you did if you’re in the area. The easiest way to find the correct place to scramble down might be to go all the way to the camp site in NC just before the trail turns up the mountain and then backtrack looking for places to access the river.

The Fork Mountain Spur continues back to Sloan Bridge for another 8 miles or so. The climb up from the river is quick and steep but switchbacks make it quite tolerable. This is probably the least traveled stretch on the Foothills Trail system. If you’re looking for solitude this is a great hike. There are nice camping opportunities at Bad Creek and Indian Camp Branch. I have hiked this section several times and never once seen another camper.

After reaching Sloan Bridge, we joined back up with the FHT for the final 4.7 miles to the Whitewater parking area.

The trip concluded with our usual post-trip meal at Dugan’s Pub in Brevard before heading home.
