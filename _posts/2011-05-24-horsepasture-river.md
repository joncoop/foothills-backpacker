The Rainbow Falls Trail in Gorges State Park is a very popular destination for dayhikers, but there are a handful of decent camping spots as well.  Rainbow Falls is the hightlight of the hike, but you’ll also see plenty of people sliding down Turtleback falls. We hiked approximately two miles to the end of the trail and found a suitable campsite for our fairly large group just past Turtleback Falls. The kids had a great time climbing on rocks and cheking out the falls. Mike and Chris even caught a few trout for dinner. The next day, we bushwhacked a bit further down a less established trail to check out Drift Falls before heading out. Drift Falls (formerly known as Bust Your Butt Falls), used to be a popular destination for sliders, but now it is on private property and the owner doesn’t allow people on the Falls.
