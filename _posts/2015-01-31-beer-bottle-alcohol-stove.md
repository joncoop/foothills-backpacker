Publix had beer in the aluminum bottles today, so I thought I’d take advantage and build a few stoves. There are plenty of videos showing how to do this. Maybe sometime I’ll put together my own video showing how to make one when you don’t have access to good tools.

I didn’t have a press to make nice rolled edges, so I just put a board on top of the die and stood on it, sort of boouncing a bit, to press the pieces together. Another tip: Fit the pieces together and drill the holes before you roll the edge. That way you can take them apart and shake the drilled metal out before you fit the pieces together permanently. I used a fine-grid sandpaper to remove the paint. The brushed metal looks pretty cool, I think. It only takes a couple minutes to make a stove once you get the hang of it. I made the windscreen from a foil baking pan.

Using an ounce of yellow Heet as fuel, I was able to boil 2 cups of water in about 8 minutes. The finished stove is 0.6 ounces.
