#### Day 1 – Deep Gap to Standing Indian Shelter (1 mile)

The drive from Highway 64 to the Deep Gap Parking area actually takes a bit of time even though it is just a little under 6 miles. The road turns from paved to a winding, but fairly well-maintained gravel road quickly. Expect this part of the drive to the trailhead to take about 25 minutes. We didn’t get to the gravel road until sunset, so we had to drive in the dark to the trailhead.

After parking, it was a very enjoyable, 1-mile night hike to the shelter. The trail was graded so that the 400-foot climb spread over one mile was hardly noticeable. The shelter has plenty of space for both tent and hammock camping along with easy access to reliable water.

#### Day 2 – Standing Indian Shelter to Betty Gap (11.5 miles)

The day started out with an easy 800-foot climb to the summit of Standing Indian Mountain. Seriously, even though it was 800 feet, it was easy. The trail is really gently graded with well-designed switchbacks where necessary. Once at the top, there are plenty of great sites plus water access. Do take the time to detour through the campsites to the actual summit of Standing Indian and check out the views. We almost walked by but turned around when another hiker told us there was a view.

From there, we hiked to Beech Gap hoping for a good water source and place to eat lunch. Our map showed water here, but there was none. It did look like there may be water flowing through the area sometimes, however we were in a particularly dry stretch of weather. No problem, however. There is reliable water just a mile further where the trail crosses Kilby Creek.

The walk was mostly wooded walking for rest of day, and never very strenuous. We stopped at Carter Gap Shelter, mostly because there was a hint of phone reception so we could take a break to listen to the Cubs game on the internet. We continued to Betty Creek Gap to camp. Water is about 5 minutes from gap at Mooney Branch. Overall, this was a very easy day.

#### Day 3 – Betty Gap to Deep Gap (12.5 miles)

Our last day started out easy with some nice ridgeline walking and occasional views. There is a very strenuous, but also short climb to summit of Albert Mountain which does involve some rock scrambling. The upper platform on the Albert Mountain fire tower is closed, but it’s still worth climb to top level of staircase.

After a stop at the tower, we took the Appalachian Trail north to the Long Branch junction. From there, we took the Long Branch trail 2 miles to the Standing Indian Campground. The trail follows Long Branch Creek but never really gets near it. It was nice getting off the AT and on a spur trail where there are no crowds. This is a really pretty stretch of trail with some maintained wildlife clearings along the way.

At the Standing Indian Campground, we continued on the Kimsey Creek trail 4.2 miles back to the Deep Gap Parking area. The first half of this trail follows the creek closely and we were fortunate to be in a dry spell. I imagine Kimsey Creek trail is very wet in summer, perhaps partially flooded for portions of the hike. Only the last mile or so of this stretch is moderately strenuous as you have to hike out of the Standing Indian Basin to get back to deep Gap.
