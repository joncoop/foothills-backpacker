#### Day 1 – Backpackers Spur Trailhead parking to Wise Shelter (2 miles)

We got to the parking area around lunchtime and at our subs at the truck before heading out. Only two miles today. This wasn’t intended to be a trip where we knock out miles. We were there for scenery and ponies. We had plenty of time check out every view on the way to the shelter and to gather firewood before hanging our hammocks in the shelter. (We waited until it was late enough that we could be sure no one else would be staying at the shelter before we hung inside.) There is a great water source about 1/3 of a mile past Wise where the trail crosses Big Wilson Creek.

#### Day 2 – Wise Shelter to Old Orchard Shelter (6 miles)

Again, no hurry to get moving. We spent the moring picking blueberries to go in our oatmeal and then spent a nice long time around camp before heading out. The first part of the walk was mostly grassy, rocky balds. There were plenty of horses (with riders) and bulls (without) around The Scales. The Scales is now a car/tent camping area, but it got its name because they used to way the cows here before sale. They found that they could get a better price high on the mountain rather than sell them at the bottom where the cows would have walked off their weight. Really interesting! From there we entered a more wooded section and decended around 1000 feet over two miles to get to the Old Orchard shelter. Again, we were there quite early in the afternoon. We had plenty of time to set up camp, gather firewood, and read in the hammocks.

#### Day 3 – Old Orchard Shelter to Thomas Knob (4 miles)

We backtracked up the AT to the junction with the Pine Mountain trail and then followed the Pine Mountian Trail for two miles. Along the way, we encountered many cows and gigantic longhorn steer, some of which were lying right on the trail. The longhorn were a bit intimidating, but they turned out to be quite docile. When approached on the trail, they generally casually looked at us and then slowly meandered to the side. The Pine Mountain Trail intersects the AT at Rhododendron Gap which is about a mile east of Thomas Knob. The only water source on the knob is behind the Thomas Knob shelter, so we went there first and then backtracked until we found a suitable site for hanging. We saw a few ponies on our way to the bald, but the highlight of our trip was when two ponies, a mom and foal joined us in our camp for most of the afternoon. (We named them Crocs and Socks.)

#### Day 4 – Thomas Knob to parking (4 miles)

On our last day, we took a long time hiking out. The views on this stretch were probably the best of the entire trip. The trails are rocky and probably difficulty, but honestly it was so beautiful that we really didn’t notice the difficulty. I don’t think we could even estimate the number of ponies we saw today. There were so many! It was peak blackberry season too, so we did plenty of snacking on the way out.
