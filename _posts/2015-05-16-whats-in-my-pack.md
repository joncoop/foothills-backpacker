If you haven’t found it already, [LighterPack.com](https://lighterpack.com) is a great tool for keeping organized and also figuring out where to cut weight. I’ll try to spare everyone the “What’s in my pack?” videos that pop up on a lot of backpackers YouTube channels. Instead, I added a sidebar feature to this site with my current pack contents. I’ll keep these updated as I acquire new gear.
